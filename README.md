Assignment 1 - UnitsConverter

In this assignment, I have created a simple UnitsConverter app that converts imperial system units to metric units.

Have made use of the following:
SplashScreen with fade in/fade out animations.
Buttons/TextViews/EditTexts/Toasts.

Follow the steps for using the app:
> Open the app (Greeted with a splashscreen).
> Make your desired choice.
> Enter the units.
> Hit Submit.
> Profit.
